# DotReviewer 
*Your AI code reviewer!*

## User Scenario
We are working at building code review tools for the following three types of users:

1. **Beginners in programming** 👶💻  
> 🚀 Start from zero!

Xiaoming is a complete beginner in C programming. He managed to write a simple "Hello, World!" program, but when it came to writing even simple code like calculating the factorial of a number, he struggled. The logic seemed difficult to grasp, and he found himself stuck on basic concepts like loops and conditionals. 🥹🥹

2. **Those with a basic understanding** (e.g., students who have studied a semester of CPL courses) 📚🧑‍🎓  
> 🌱 Take your coding skills to the next level! 🚀

Xiaoming enrolled in the CPL course this semester. When working on his assignments, he found that his code could never pass the online judge (OJ). Frustrated, he decided to ask the teaching assistant (TA) for help. The TA took a look at his code and immediately noticed the issues: the variable names were confusing, the indentation was inconsistent, and the code was cluttered with redundant lines and unnecessary comments. The TA politely declined his request and said: "Please fix your code style before asking for help." 😤😤

3. **Those proficient in one language but looking to quickly switch to another language** 💬🔄  
> ⚡ Seamlessly switch languages with ease!

Xiaoming has become proficient in C language 💪. However, when he started writing Python, he often felt out of his depth. He would try to "reinvent the wheel" by manually implementing features that Python already provides in its libraries, sticking to the C-style mindset. This led to inefficient and overly complex solutions, as he wasn't fully utilizing Python's unique features and capabilities, like dynamic typing, list comprehensions, and built-in libraries. Xiaoming realized that to truly excel in Python, he needed to embrace its strengths and stop trying to force his C knowledge onto it. He really needs a tool to help his code become more *pythonic* 🐍💻.
